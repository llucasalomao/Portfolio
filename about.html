    <h2 class="first">Who am I?</h2>
    <p>I'm a college student in the arts who studied socioeconomic sciences in high school.
        I'm a shy person who likes to express himself through art, mainly through photography and the music I listen to.</p>
</div>
    <div>
        <h2 class="question">Why the sudden change of study area?</h2>
        <p>I have always had photography as one of my favorite hobbies and I had never thought of following this path as my career. But after 3 years studying economics in high school, I realized that it wasn't what I wanted to do, so when I found the course I'm on today, I was sure it was the right path for me.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2 class="question">What do I do in my free time?</h2>
        <p>As I already said, I love photography and music, but they are not the only activities I like to do. I've always really enjoyed painting pictures, sewing, playing sports and like any young person, I love spending time with my closest friends.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2 class="question">What sports have I played?</h2>
        <p>Currently I practice 4 sports: Football, Futsal, Handball and Basketball, but when I was younger I trained Judo and Rugby.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2 class="question">What kind of music do I listen to?</h2>
        <p>I would say that I love music in general, but my favorite genres are rock, pop and alternative-rap/emo-rap. Some of my favorite artists are Lil Peep, Queen and Taylor Swift. </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2 class="question">What was my inspiration to start taking pictures?</h2>
        <p>Ever since I can remember, I've watched my father's love for photography and I'll never forget the day that he lent me one of his cameras to help him shoot a family event and I've loved photography ever since.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2 class="question">What is my favorite photography style?</h2>
        <p>That depends. If we're talking about my favorite pictures to take, I would have to say probably landscape, something inspired by the group F/64. If we're talking about something I really want to do in the future, I would say probably sports like Basketball or Formula 1 and Fashion.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2 class="question">What do I want for my future?</h2>
        <p>When I finish my degree, I intend to do a master's degree in Fashion Design and my goal is to one day be able to combine my knowledge from the degree with the master's to create my own clothing brand.</p>
